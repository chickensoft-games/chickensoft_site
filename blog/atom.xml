We'll spend the rest of the blog defending that statement and addressing common concerns about Godot.</p><p>Over the last few months, I've heard dozens of questions from interested users about Godot, the C# support it provides, and the future of the engine. It's important to note that I am in no way officially affiliated with the Godot Engine organization. I have, however, spoken with some of the core engine developers and contributors and <strong>I'd like to put the arguments against Godot and C# to rest, once and for all.</strong></p><p>There's a lot to cover, and it's all good news — so let's dive in!</p><blockquote><p>Unrelated: this blog has officially moved away from Medium!<sup id="fnref-1-61f224"><a href="#fn-1-61f224" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup></p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-godots-big-year">🎇 Godot's Big Year<a href="#-godots-big-year" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🎇 Godot's Big Year" title="Direct link to 🎇 Godot's Big Year">​</a></h2><p>If you haven't been watching too closely, you might have missed some of the news!

We'll come back to that in a bit.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overwhelming-support">Overwhelming Support<a href="#overwhelming-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Overwhelming Support" title="Direct link to Overwhelming Support">​</a></h3><p>Godot continues to receive an overwhelming amount of support from the community. The creator of Godot, <a href="https://twitter.com/reduzio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juan Linietsky</a>, describes how Godot suffers from the best possible problem:</p><blockquote><p>we have too many people who are doing things really really efficiently and really well."<sup id="fnref-2-61f224"><a href="#fn-2-61f224" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Essentially, the sheer number of contributors (1,800+ on GitHub) almost guarantees that any specific feature is being worked on at any given moment.</p><p>On <a href="https://www.patreon.com/godotengine/posts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patreon</a>, Godot now receives over <strong><code>$15,000 USD</code></strong> of donations <em>per month</em>. That's an increase of <code>$2,000 USD</code> per month since I last checked on it in the summer.</p><p>The Godot subreddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">r/godot</a>, now has over <strong>101,000 members</strong>, an <strong>increase of at least 5,000 users</strong> since the summer (probably in large part to <a href="/blog/indie-game-godot#unrest-in-the-indie-c-game-dev-world">Unity's missteps</a>). The official <a href="https://discord.gg/4JBkykG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Godot Discord</a> now has over <strong>50,000 users</strong>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="️-addressing-your-concerns">💁‍♀️ Addressing Your Concerns<a href="#️-addressing-your-concerns" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 💁‍♀️ Addressing Your Concerns" title="Direct link to 💁‍♀️ Addressing Your Concerns">​</a></h2><p>On Reddit (and occasionally elsewhere), interested users will ask if C# is "ready" or a "first-class" citizen in Godot. The answer is simple: <strong>yes</strong>.</p><p>If you don't believe me, read on. We'll respond to each of the common arguments against Godot and its support for C#.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wheres-the-asset-store">Where's the asset store?<a href="#wheres-the-asset-store" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Where's the asset store?" title="Direct link to Where's the asset store?">​</a></h3><p>When I tell people that Godot is a viable Unity alternative, this is usually the first counterargument I hear, and for good reason. Godot doesn't have a monetization system for assets...<em>yet</em>.</p><p>Of course, Godot does have an official <a href="https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asset Library</a> with over 1,500 assets, but they're all free. 🙁</p><p>Most of us would normally be thrilled about free assets, but when you're an artist or developer who relies on selling your assets to support yourself, giving away your products is a no-go. It's only fair that you should be able to make a living doing what you're good at.</p><p>Monetization, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/o5pam9/comment/h2o1u5w/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">someone pointed out on Reddit</a>, requires a lot of bureaucratic effort. Collecting payments and being responsible for payment handling is a gigantic chore.</p><p>In 2021, the founder of Godot —&nbsp;Juan Linietsky —&nbsp;confirmed a paid asset marketplace was on the way.</p><article class="post_OH9c dark_Lat8"><section class="postWrapper_XtBt"><a href="https://twitter.com/reduzio" class="postHeaderLink_r5Jp"><header class="postHeader_ydRB"><img class="postHeaderAvatar_eJLl" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/687707525827964929/ZfJ5WBtG_normal.jpg"><section class="postAvatarText_vPE3"><span class="postDisplayName_xin6">Juan Linietsky</span><span class="postUsername_uT8m">reduzio</span></section><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="postLogoTwitter_W4eX" width="24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M23.643 4.937c-.835.37-1.732.62-2.675.733.962-.576 1.7-1.49 2.048-2.578-.9.534-1.897.922-2.958 1.13-.85-.904-2.06-1.47-3.4-1.47-2.572 0-4.658 2.086-4.658 4.66 0 .364.042.718.12 1.06-3.873-.195-7.304-2.05-9.602-4.868-.4.69-.63 1.49-.63 2.342 0 1.616.823 3.043 2.072 3.878-.764-.025-1.482-.234-2.11-.583v.06c0 2.257 1.605 4.14 3.737 4.568-.392.106-.803.162-1.227.162-.3 0-.593-.028-.877-.082.593 1.85 2.313 3.198 4.352 3.234-1.595 1.25-3.604 1.995-5.786 1.995-.376 0-.747-.022-1.112-.065 2.062 1.323 4.51 2.093 7.14 2.093 8.57 0 13.255-7.098 13.255-13.254 0-.2-.005-.402-.014-.602.91-.658 1.7-1.477 2.323-2.41z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></header></a><section class="postContent_srqa"><p>Just to clarify because this seems like a large source of misunderstandings.

Godot's size merits the flexibility of having its own organization and the opportunity to explore broader funding sources.</p><p>Examples of this are crowdfunding campaigns (like Blender or Krita do), the highly requested ability for users to sell assets on an asset library (and have a share going to the Godot Foundation), selling merchandise, and other types of funding.</p></blockquote><p>While that doesn't solve the problem today, you can probably get pretty far with the 1,500+ free assets that already exist.</p><p>For some users, having access to a multitude of assets is non-negotiable. Those users will not use Godot until its asset library is a thriving, paid marketplace. For most developers, however, I believe the boost in developer productivity Godot provides over Unity <em>et al.</em> more than makes up for any reduction in assets.</p><p>For example: if you're creating your own art, or purchasing art and models from artists, you're probably writing all your own custom code anyways. Why not do it in Godot? The editor won't <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PpkAhVZMDc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hang for 2 minutes straight</a> whenever it decides to scan your assets, unlike in other engines, <em>cough cough</em>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-about-c">What About C#?<a href="#what-about-c" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What About C#?" title="Direct link to What About C#?">​</a></h3><p>People often ask "is C# a first class citizen?" when looking into Godot and C#. I believe the question became popular when Godot first introduced C#. Like all new features, C# support was initially incomplete and poorly documented, but solidified over time. These days, the <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Godot Docs</a> provide almost every code example in both C# and GDScript, and C# support in Godot 3 (LTS) is incredibly robust.</p><p>If you are looking for C# API docs, <a href="https://twitter.com/pauljoannon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paulloz</a> maintains a <a href="https://paulloz.github.io/godot-csharp-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">C# version of the Godot API docs</a>.</p><p>Just to reiterate, <strong>Godot supports two first-party programming languages: GDScript and C#</strong>. All other language bindings are unofficial, third party projects.</p><p>When asked if the new <code>GDExtension</code> support in Godot would replace the need for first-party C# support, <a href="https://github.com/neikeq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neikeq</a> (one of the core Godot C# contributors), explained that C# support would continue to be built-in because it would be difficult (if even possible) <a href="https://discord.com/channels/862108653488963604/1039016978528088074/1039212956438773843" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to load more than one .NET assembly through a native extension</a>.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="future-of-c-support">Future of C# Support<a href="#future-of-c-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Future of C# Support" title="Direct link to Future of C# Support">​</a></h4><p>I asked <a href="https://github.com/neikeq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neikeq</a> a couple of questions about C# in Godot via private message in Discord, and with their permission I am posting some of the interview here (lightly edited for clarity):</p><blockquote><p><strong>me</strong>: A lot of people are on the fence about Godot because they're not sure C# support is planned long term, or maybe they've been burned by the lack of documentation in the past. What do you want them to know?</p><p><strong>neikeq</strong>:
They shouldn't worry about C# support in the long term. There was a lot of concern about that this year because initially C# wasn't included with the Godot 4 alpha releases, but now it's already there and soon it will be unified as a single version of Godot.</p><p>One of the most important factors for the future of C# support is that starting with Godot 4, it's much easier to maintain. There is still room for improvement (for example, changing/adding a type for marshalling takes a bit more work right now). But the amount of work we took off our shoulders is huge. That's time that can be spent on other parts like addressing issues.</p><p>Hopefully there will be less confusion about some things as well. Previous marshalling errors that would be printed at runtime are now compiler errors.</p><p><strong>me</strong>: Is the maintenance effort easier because of the new source generators, or other changes that were made?</p><p><strong>neikeq</strong>: We no longer build the Mono runtime ourselves, which was especially painful on platforms like wasm, iOS and even Android sometimes. As well as having to maintain build code for some of those platforms and ensuring that it works (like AOT for iOS). That's all offloaded to MSBuild with the official .NET releases. Granted we don't have mobile and wasm support yet but when the time comes, it will be easier to implement. The new hosting + pure C# + source generators is also easier to maintain than our previous approach with the Mono embedding APIs (although marshalling needs to be improved in this regard as I mentioned).</p><p><strong>me</strong>: Any closing words to those who were worried C# support was going away?</p><p><strong>neikeq</strong>: <strong><em>We don't have any intention of removing C# support because a lot of people in the industry communicate to us that C# support is a big factor in adopting the engine.</em></strong></p></blockquote><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-bigger-c-ecosystem">A Bigger C# Ecosystem<a href="#a-bigger-c-ecosystem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Bigger C# Ecosystem" title="Direct link to A Bigger C# Ecosystem">​</a></h3><p>Still skeptical about taking the plunge on an open source game engine?

🐤 Free Stuff from Chickensoft">​</a></h2><p>Chickensoft had a good first year: what originally started as a C#-focused fan club for Godot has blossomed into a small community of enthusiastic package authors and game developers.

When trying to make my code reusable across game projects, I realized there was no easy way to keep my addons up to date while I was still developing them. Likewise, whenever I created a new sandbox project, I had to copy a dozen or so files into the new project every time.</p><p>Chicken's addon management system allows you to declare dependencies in their own file (to prevent versioning headaches with git submodules), while template generation enables you to quickly create new projects without having to copy over all the files you need each time.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="addon-management-simplified">Addon Management, Simplified<a href="#addon-management-simplified" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Addon Management, Simplified" title="Direct link to Addon Management, Simplified">​</a></h4><p>Godot addons are simply git repositories with an <code>addons/your_addon_name</code> folder inside them. The contents of that folder (scenes, scripts, art assets, etc) will be copied to a project folder's <code>addons/your_addon_name</code> when a user installs your addon. Because addons are a flat folder structure, people often think to use git submodules for addons in their project repositories. I initially tried git submodules and found it was too difficult to keep everything up-to-date across all of my projects that were using the addons.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>When using C# with Godot, you have two mechanisms for reusing code: addons and nuget packages.</p><p>Importing nuget packages is as simple as adding them to your Godot project's <code>.csproj</code> file.

At first glance, Unity is so laughably ahead of Godot in sheer number of features supported that it seems comical to compare the two. One is an industry behemoth and the world’s most popular game engine, while the other is a free, 30 megabyte program developed by passionate developers in their free time.</p><p>Unity can <em>technically</em> do much more than Godot, at least on paper. In practice, Unity requires 3rd party tools for tweens, timers, and networking, all of which Godot includes out-of-the-box. Still, I’d argue that <em>it doesn’t actually matter</em> for the vast majority of us indie game developers. The rest of this blog only exists to convince you of that argument.</p><p>Do you want to make the world’s best-looking game with the latest, buggy technologies, or do you want to <em>actually have fun</em> making games? If you said yes to the last part of that question, I’d like to invite you to try <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Godot</a>. If you’ve already tried Godot a while back and gave up, I’d like to ask you to give Godot another chance. It might be better now than you realize.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="unity-isnt-fun-anymore">Unity isn’t fun anymore<a href="#unity-isnt-fun-anymore" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Unity isn’t fun anymore" title="Direct link to Unity isn’t fun anymore">​</a></h2><p>It’s no secret that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PpkAhVZMDc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unity is painful to use</a>: it’s slow to open, and it often pauses to re-scan the entire project while you’re trying to work. If you’re trying to use source control with a few other people, you have to work even harder to get everything to play nice with Unity’s unique file formats. By modern standards, Unity development can feel a bit backwards at times.</p><p>When you open Godot, it opens almost instantaneously. The UI is just the right size, and all of the controls are easily accessible in a few simple panes you can rearrange to your liking.</p><p>In Godot, everything is composed of nodes. No prefabs, game components, or other abstractions to learn. Just nodes. A scene is just a tree of nodes, saved as a plain text file in a familiar configuration format that you can easily read in a text editor. Need to quickly edit a scene to fix a reference to a file that was renamed or moved outside of Godot? Just open it up in your code editor and fix the path. When you switch back to the Godot editor, it will reload the project before you can blink. There’s no difficulty with source control, either: everything just works because everything’s text.</p><p>Godot also gives you full control of your <code>.csproj</code> file, allowing you to setup dependencies and configure MSBuild as much as you want. Want to use code generators? You can do that. Custom Roslyn analyzers? Go for it. Your own nuget packages? Check.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="its-actually-fun-to-use-godot">It's actually fun to use Godot<a href="#its-actually-fun-to-use-godot" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to It's actually fun to use Godot" title="Direct link to It's actually fun to use Godot">​</a></h2><p>Godot doesn’t fight you when you’re building scenes. Making a scene feels a lot like creating a class using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">composition</a>, and scenes can even <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/issues/5529" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inherit</a> from other scenes (using another scene as the the root node of a scene allows you to inherit from it and override its properties in the editor and in code), allowing you to express patterns you’re intimately familiar with from object-oriented programming.</p><p>Wasn’t "having fun" the whole point of making a game in C#, anyways? Using a managed language was supposed to make creating games easier, not harder. <em>Don’t worry about all the bits and bytes, C# will take care of it for you.</em> Sadly, we lost that along the way when for-profit game engine companies decided to prioritize the monetization of their tools over the happiness of their users. It isn’t that way with Godot: making C# games is fun again.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="but-what-about-unitys-asset-store">But what about Unity's asset store?<a href="#but-what-about-unitys-asset-store" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to But what about Unity's asset store?" title="Direct link to But what about Unity's asset store?">​</a></h2><p>"Alright, I want to switch to Godot," you say, "but I need those high quality paid assets from the Unity Asset Store since I’m not an artist/musician/expert coder/etc."</p><p>Unfortunately, the paid asset store is the biggest sacrifice you’ll have to make. While it can’t always compare to Unity’s paid offerings, the <a href="https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Godot Asset Library</a> offers 1300+ creations <em>for free</em>. Have you seen <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/awesome-godot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all of the awesome stuff</a> people have made in Godot?</p><blockquote><p>It’s possible that <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot-asset-library/issues/126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">donations or payments will be coming to the Godot Asset Library</a>, allowing creators to be rewarded for their work, but I haven’t heard anything conclusive just yet. If it does, expect a lot more high-quality assets in the near future.</p></blockquote><p>Most people would probably agree that being retired with a terrible disease that affects your quality of life is a lot worse than being retired in good health. So why would you keep using a game engine that’s making you miserable? Making games is supposed to be <em>fun</em>!</p><p>If it’s just the Unity Asset Store holding you back, there’s probably nothing I can say to convince you to give Godot a chance. But if you’re resourceful and don’t mind a little extra work, and/or you’re willing to port your scripts over and import your 3D models into Godot, you might be pleasantly surprised by what you’re missing.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="youre-the-star-of-the-show">You’re the star of the show<a href="#youre-the-star-of-the-show" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to You’re the star of the show" title="Direct link to You’re the star of the show">​</a></h2><p>Godot prioritizes developer experience. I don’t think that’s explicitly written in the docs, and I’ve never heard anyone else say it, but that’s how I feel when I use Godot. Sure, it has fewer features than the dominating game engines, but the “few” features it does have are so polished and well thought-out that it’s a joy to use. When I use Godot, I feel special. Godot’s docs are thorough, well-written, and explanatory. If you’re really stuck, you can look through it’s source code (I’ve actually done that a few times and figured things out). Everything just works (generally), right out of the box!</p><p>Did you know that killer features like Godot 4’s <code>NavigationServer</code> (with local object avoidance) <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/release-candidate-godot-3-5-rc-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are now available</a> as of 3.5? You can even compute navigation meshes at runtime. The Godot developers prove their commitment to you by back-porting some of the most valuable features that were developed for 4.0. They’re doing that because <em>you — the game developer</em> — are the focal point of their universe.</p><p>The Godot team is not seeking commercial success. It’s the same strategy that worked for Blender: make the best possible program <em>for the people</em>. They couldn’t make it any clearer: the Godot team wants you to have a good time making games!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ill-wait-until-the-next-version">"I’ll wait until the next version."<a href="#ill-wait-until-the-next-version" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to &quot;I’ll wait until the next version.&quot;" title="Direct link to &quot;I’ll wait until the next version.&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A lot of people are holding out for Godot 4.0. Either they’re procrastinating, or they sincerely believe Godot can’t do what they want it to do. That might be true for a big team making the next big thing, but for most of us indie devs — really? You can’t start work on <em>anything</em> yet just because Godot doesn’t have LOD? I have a hard time believing that.</p><p>Long-time Unity users probably know the feeling of waking up to find out that a feature they really enjoyed (or relied on) was getting axed because Unity wanted to monetize something differently instead of <em>just making the developers happy.</em></p><p>Chances are, by the time you succeed in pushing the limits of Godot, a new version will have been released that can do even more.</p><p>We’re not waiting on Godot anymore, and neither should you. It’s time for you to be happy.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="c-in-godot-where-were-at-in-2022">C# in Godot: where we’re at in 2022<a href="#c-in-godot-where-were-at-in-2022" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to C# in Godot: where we’re at in 2022" title="Direct link to C# in Godot: where we’re at in 2022">​</a></h2><p>C# support in Godot has come a long ways since it was first introduced years ago. Godot allows you to use C# 10, which makes for an incredible developer experience (Unity doesn’t even fully support C# 9).</p><p>While the C# Godot community is fairly small (about <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-OIpxXqou9cDnPXEAjxzpICbf8_YZB3jUizdECXRydtB8cA/viewanalytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">14% of the approximately 5,000</a> users who responded to the Godot Community Poll 2022 are using C#), we’ve been able to create <a href="https://github.com/chickensoft-games/chicken" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">addon managers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chickensoft-games/go_dot_test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">test frameworks</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Carnagion/GDSerializer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">serializers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Carnagion/Modot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mod loaders</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chickensoft-games/go_dot_log" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">logging</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chickensoft-games/go_dot_net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">node-based dependency managers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chickensoft-games/GameTemplate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam integrations</a>, and so much more.</p><p>On Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">r/Godot</a> has 90,000+ members.

In spite of it all, the community has helped me accomplish everything I’ve ever wanted to do.</p><blockquote><p>I’ve spent a lot of time documenting how to setup C# projects in Godot, especially since a lot of the people wanting to use C# with Godot are fairly new to it. If you want some examples and documentation for how to setup and structure your project, I highly encourage you to check out some of the GitHub repositories for my organization, <a href="https://github.com/chickensoft-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chickensoft</a>.

For a while, that was very difficult, unless you were using XUnit with <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rider</a> (which has its own challenges).</p><p>Testing is no longer difficult to setup. There are multiple libraries for writing tests for C# Godot code, including Chickensoft's official <a href="https://github.com/chickensoft-games/go_dot_test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">test framework, go_dot_test</a> that lets you debug tests from VSCode, collect coverage, and run tests from the command line.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-missing-in-the-godot-c-ecosystem">What’s missing in the Godot C# ecosystem?<a href="#whats-missing-in-the-godot-c-ecosystem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s missing in the Godot C# ecosystem?" title="Direct link to What’s missing in the Godot C# ecosystem?">​</a></h3><p>While Godot’s C# support is truly incredible, the ecosystem is fairly light on utilities, particularly networking frameworks and deep editor integrations for C#. There’s also no single, direct equivalent to tools like <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Odin</a> for Unity. If you’re up for the challenge of being an early adopter and lie awake at night thinking about open source software, you could be the one to create the next big, useful tool for the Godot C# world.</p><p>While Godot has incredible, easy-to-use RPC networking support built into the current 3.x versions, it doesn’t have the ability to swap out transports to use something like Steamworks or other messaging protocols under the hood, at least from what I understand. <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/multiplayer-changes-godot-4-0-report-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That might be coming in 4.0</a>.</p><p>Even so, we're currently building our own networking library in C# for Godot, loosely inspired by <a href="https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mirror</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netcode for GameObjects</a> that circumvents Godot’s networking entirely, for those who might want a more custom approach to networking or need to support certain transports. I’ll take all the help I can get, too, because I am way out of my depth on this one!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-else-should-i-know-about-c-in-godot">What else should I know about C# in Godot?<a href="#what-else-should-i-know-about-c-in-godot" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What else should I know about C# in Godot?" title="Direct link to What else should I know about C# in Godot?">​</a></h3><p>Like other engines, Godot marshals types back and forth between its C++ and C# layers. Not all types can convert into one of Godot’s types, but it isn’t as big of a problem as you might think. For most game logic, you can create classes, records, and structs the way you normally would, and everything will work fine in the C# layer.</p><p>If you need to pass a type to a Godot subsystem, or to a node that’s using GDScript, you’ll want to make sure any custom objects involved are C# classes that extend <code>Godot.Object</code> (or <code>Godot.Reference</code>), since that’s the only way Godot can serialize and track values correctly (the c++ layer uses reference counting, not garbage collection). You can also use C#’s events, which are strongly typed, but if you need to interface with node events, you should use Godot’s signal system. In general, I tend to prefer vanilla C# features over Godot types to avoid marshaling penalties and to leverage C#’s strong typing. When I need to interface with Godot nodes, GDScript, or anything that expects Godot types, I adopt Godot’s way of doing things. So far, that has worked out really well for me, and I think it will for you, too.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-about-asynchrony">What about asynchrony?<a href="#what-about-asynchrony" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What about asynchrony?" title="Direct link to What about asynchrony?">​</a></h3><p>Using <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> with C#’s Task can be a bit of a headache with Godot, especially if you don’t realize that that most ways of executing an async Task in C# starts a new thread (or recycles one from the task thread pool). In general, I recommend avoiding asynchrony where possible, unless you have a good way of keeping it self-contained and use it only where absolutely necessary, such as for loading systems or in integration tests (where you need to <code>await</code> across frames). If you can’t escape asynchrony, you can always use C# events to interface with the rest of your synchronous code to keep things simple.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="c-constructors-and-godot">C# constructors and Godot<a href="#c-constructors-and-godot" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to C# constructors and Godot" title="Direct link to C# constructors and Godot">​</a></h3><p>Because of the way Godot spins up classes, you should avoid creating values in your Godot Node’s constructor and instead initialize values when Godot calls your node’s <code>_Ready</code> method. If you try to do it too early, you introduce a lot of instability in your game. Since C# doesn’t have a <code>late</code> modifier (Dart) or <code>lazy</code> (Kotlin), you can simply initialize values to <code>null</code> (or <code>null!</code> if you’re using null-aware code) and finish initializing your fields in <code>_Ready</code>.</p><p>I know that’s a little technical, but knowing those few things should save you a few headaches. It certainly would have helped us!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="open-source-always-wins">Open source always wins<a href="#open-source-always-wins" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Open source always wins" title="Direct link to Open source always wins">​</a></h2><p>Godot may not ever be the dominating game engine, but we believe an open source game engine will dominate the field someday, given enough time. Godot prioritizes developers, and when developers win, everyone else eventually wins, too.</p><p>So what are you waiting on? It’s certainly not Godot.
