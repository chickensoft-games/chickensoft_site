## 👩‍🏫 About Chickensoft

Chickensoft is an open source organization dedicated to the C# Godot community. We host a [Discord] server dedicated to providing support for developers writing games, applications, and tools with Godot and C#.

All Chickensoft projects are free to use for personal and commercial projects under the MIT license. See our [license] page for more information.

### 📖 What's here?

Chickensoft is home to a number of open source projects. Since some of these projects are quite involved, their documentation is hosted here. You can see all of Chickensoft's projects on the [home page](/).

In addition, we are striving to better document general C# and Godot development. Want to add notes about a particular topic? Feel free to contribute to the open source [Chickensoft Website][website-repo]!

### 🐤 Why the name?

Chickensoft began as a silly personal organization for my game development projects. While making games with Godot, I ended up creating a few utilities along the way to make C# development a bit easier. Now that the projects have a life of their own, I've given up trying to ever release a game. If for some reason I do release a commercial game, it will be under a different name. 🥲

### 🪦 A Word of Caution

To all game developers I offer this word of caution: **Don't make tools — make games.** Otherwise, you will just end up writing documentation for tools that may (or may not) help others make games. <sup>At worst, you may fall into the dark pit that is [writing an entire engine][not-invented-here].</sup>

Unfortunately, _"not making tools"_ and _"actually making games"_ is a hard pill to swallow for game developers. Game [development is notoriously hard][game-development-hard], even _without_ the temptation to write tools. When you finally do succeed in making a game, we'll be there to cheer you on in the community Discord server!

If you still won't listen, feel free to [contribute][org]. Just know you are treading down a dark path full of unfinished projects and broken dreams. 😶‍🌫️
