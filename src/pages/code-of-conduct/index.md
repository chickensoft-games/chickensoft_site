# Code of Conduct

The Chickensoft team adheres to the [Contributor Covenant][contributor-covenant]. We ask external contributors to also follow the same guidelines.

In general, be kind to others, assume good faith interactions, and avoid making personal remarks. Discrimination of any type is not tolerated. We rely on moderator discretion and do our best to create a positive atmosphere in Discord, on GitHub, and anywhere else we might interact with others.
