May 5-7, 2025 marks the first US-based GodotCon in Boston, MA. The schedule is packed with talks from veteran Godot contributors and enthusiasts, and we're extremely proud to be among those selected to present at this inaugural event!

We are thrilled to announce that our very own [Mark Wilson](/team/mrkwlsn) will be representing us at GodotCon 2025. On May 7th, [Mark will be speaking on *Enjoyable Game Architecture*](https://conference.godotengine.org/2025/schedule/), outlining Chickensoft's open source tools and the guiding principles behind them.

> Architecting games can be challenging, and Chickensoft looks to provide direct, opinionated, open-source solutions to help developers overcome those challenges. In my talk, I'll discuss the history of Chickensoft and the inspiration for some of the core Chickensoft packages. I'll also talk about specific challenges developers can face building reliable, well-engineered games and how various Chickensoft tools can help address those challenges.

Mark is one of the Chickensoft administrators and has been a long-time contributor to Chickensoft's community and software projects. We're super excited to see him take the stage and share Chickensoft's ethos with the broader community.

If you're attending GodotCon, feel free to stop by and say hi to Mark!
