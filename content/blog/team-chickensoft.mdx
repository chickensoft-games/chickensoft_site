If you've been here before, you might have noticed that we've completely reworked the Chickensoft website! We've given the design a refresh and migrated to a different toolchain. The website is now able to store more types of data and render on the server, allowing us to create a better experience for our visitors.,

As part of the updates, we've added a new [team](/team) section â€” and, speaking of teams, we have a lot of updates to cover!

## Meet the Chickensoft Team

[Mark Wilson](/team/mrkwlsn) is now administrating Chickensoft alongside of [myself](/team/joanna). Mark has administrator access to most all of the relevant services, including GitHub and Discord â€” this prevents me from becoming a single point of failure. Mark is a Chickensoft community veteran, former researcher, and a great leader. Lately, he has made a number of [contributions to GodotEnv](https://github.com/chickensoft-games/GodotEnv/pulls?q=author%3Awlsnmrk), [reworked our logging packages](https://github.com/chickensoft-games/Log/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Awlsnmrk), and helped with a number of other refactors and maintenance chores. Mark has been a big contributor to Chickensoft for quite some time and he has my full trust and confidence to run the organization. He brings a huge breadth of technical insight and experience to Chickensoft.

We're also welcoming [Matt](/team/matt): Matt is our resident networking and Steamworks enthusiast. He's already [helped us contribute to Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET/pull/685), as well as making improvements to GodotEnv and [working on the Steam integration](https://github.com/chickensoft-games/GameDemo/pull/120) for the demo game that we maintain.

Matt is also available for hire â€” if you're looking for an incredibly gifted engineer, [look no further](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-makary/).

Finally, we're thrilled to welcome [Dan](/team/dan) to the team! Dan brings a massive amount of technical knowledge and experience, and he's already helped us overhaul how we use tools like [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) to properly manage automatic dependency updates, as well as made difficult improvements to [LogicBlocks](https://github.com/chickensoft-games/LogicBlocks/pulls?q=author%3Axodial).

<Author authorId="dan" />

Besides an impressive industry background, he's an automation and tooling expert â€” something we have desperately needed help with given the number of projects we are now maintaining. We're thrilled to have Dan on board to teach us how to run projects at scale.

## Community Organizers

If you've been with us in Discord, you likely already know our other moderators.

Paul is a long-time Godot contributor and Chickensoft community organizer. Paul works as a freelance game developer and has helped a staggering number of people by answering extremely difficult, nuanced technical questions in our community Discord. Whenever I run into something I can't answer, I ask Paul. He somehow manages to do all of this while maintaining [Godot Ink](https://github.com/paulloz/godot-ink), too.

You might have also spoken to Mark D. (Mr. Dink), another long-time moderator who's been with us since the beginning. Mark is passionate about designing stats and status effect systems, serialization, and game architecture. He's helped numerous folks with their questions and even [reworked the parallax system in Godot](https://godotengine.org/article/parallax-progress-report/).

And, if you've talked to Mark at all, you know that Mark is always telling jokes. Besides his incredible technical expertise, he brings a warm disposition and a ton of fun to every conversation!

Finally, you may have interacted with Angelo (Man) from our Discord community, another esteemed Chickensoft moderator. Angelo is an experienced indie developer and game jammer, bringing his wisdom and experience to the Chickensoft community. Over the last few years, he's helped a ton of others with their technical problems. He was also a developer for the well-received indie game [Arctic Eggs](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2763670/Arctic_Eggs/), and has even finished a few game jams with [something to show for it](https://itch.io/profile/abmarnie). He also maintains the [Godot Architecture Organization Advice](https://github.com/abmarnie/godot-architecture-organization-advice) repository.

## The Chickensoft Community

Game development is extremely challenging because it overlaps with so many disciplines. But it shouldn't be painful...and it certainly shouldn't be lonely. Chickensoft is home to some 1,500+ developers in our community Discord server, as well as over 20 open source tools. We want to empower game developers and studios to build and ship high-quality games *today* with a state-of-the-art, open source game engine.

At it's core, Chickensoft is a volunteer organization which provides a community Discord for Godot + C# developers that's moderated by veteran Godot contributors and enthusiasts. We tend to be a somewhat quiet (but friendly) community with a strong focus on C#. We're not afraid of lengthy technical discussions and we often debate ways of designing better game architectures or discussing how tools can be improved.

Over the years, our community has grown into a volunteer team of developers creating and maintaining open source tools that make it easier to handle production use cases with Godot and C#. The [tools we provide](/#projects) are specifically designed to tackle the hardest parts of game development: [CI/CD](https://github.com/chickensoft-games/setup-godot), [environment management](https://github.com/chickensoft-games/GodotEnv), [hierarchical state machines](https://github.com/chickensoft-games/LogicBlocks), [serialization](https://github.com/chickensoft-games/Serialization/), [dependency injection](https://github.com/chickensoft-games/AutoInject), [templates](https://github.com/chickensoft-games/GodotGame), and even a [demo game](https://github.com/chickensoft-games/GameDemo) that does all of those things.

We [dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) our projects by using them in our own projects and demo game. Many of us are industry veterans who pride ourselves on bringing production-grade tooling to the game development world. We believe [game development should be fun](http://localhost:3000/blog/game-architecture), [free](https://godotengine.org/license/), and supported by a [friendly community of developers](/).

We're essentially building the missing secondary tooling that the industry needs to adopt the Godot engine in large projects which benefit from C#'s type safety, package ecosystem, speed, flexibility, and familiarity. For more on that, you can read our detailed [technical philosophy](/philosophy). We also have an [about page](/about) which describes our history.

We're extremely grateful to everyone who's contributed to Chickensoft: whether that's helping someone in the community, contributing to the software packages, or simply sending a link to someone else. It would be impossible to maintain all these packages without the support of the entire community â€” so thank you! ðŸ¥³
