Hey there! I’m Chickensoft’s resident Networking & Steamworks engineer. I thrive on the challenges of multiplayer architecture and love building networked experiences that bring players together. When I’m not deep in the internals of netcode, you’ll usually find me tinkering with electronics or sharing my knowledge over at my YouTube channel!
