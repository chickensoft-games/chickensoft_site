## Logo

The Chickensoft logo is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 (CC BY-ND 4.0) license][cc-by-nd-4.0]. In short, you may copy and redistribute the logo in any form (on your game's splash screen, for instance), even in commercial projects. However, you must provide attribution to Chickensoft somewhere in your project or credits, and you may not redistribute modified versions of the logo.

## 3D Chickensoft Mascot

The 3D Chickensoft Mascot Model and animations, used in the Game Demo, are under different licenses.

### Chickensoft Mascot Model

The Chickensoft 3D Mascot Model is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY 4.0) license][cc-by-4.0]. In short, this allows you to use, make derivatives, and share your derivatives, even for commercial purposes, so long as you attribute and give credit to Chickensoft somewhere in your project or credits.

Since the Chickensoft mascot represents Chickensoft, we require attribution if you use it for anything other than personal use â€” that's it!

### Chickensoft Mascot Animations

The Chickensoft 3D Mascot Model animations are licensed under the [CC0 1.0 license][cc0]. This allows you to use, make derivatives, and share your derivatives, even for commercial purposes, without any attribution or credit required.

Why? So that you can re-target the animations to your own similar models and rigs without needing to worry about where you got them from. There need to be more totally free game animations in the world!
