description: Chickensoft technical documentation.

Chickensoft maintains a number of open source projects. Most of the documentation for these projects is on each repository's GitHub page, but some projects which require more documentation (such as LogicBlocks) are hosted here. We also host opinionated setup guides as well as other information specific to Godot + C# development that we feel is helpful.

For links to all of our projects, please see our [home page](/).
