LogicBlocks was designed with testability in mind. States can be fully tested independently of the logic block they are used with.

For the sake of clarity, we'll write tests based on the code we create in the [tutorial]. If you haven't read that yet, give it a quick once-over before continuing.

The Chickensoft packages tend to use [Moq] for mocking and [Shouldly] for assertions, so we'll leverage those in the documentation, too.
